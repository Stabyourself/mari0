# Gateway Jump

Gateway Jump is a platformer with a gun which opens gateways. It is based
on the Mari0 game developed by Stabyourself.net. That game combined Super
Mario Brothers and Portal. The game assets were mostly taken from Super
Mario Brothers. Gateway Jump has been replacing all the assets to make
it easier to legally distribute the game.
